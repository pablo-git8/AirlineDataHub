## Project Overview

This project is centered around a CSV data feed, which will be ingested into our data repositories. The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

### Data Analysis and Cleaning
- Conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to ensure its readiness for ingestion into our data warehouse. 
- Develop Python scripts that outlines the specific tests and ETL procedures to be applied to the dataset. This script should articulate:
  - The identification and handling of any anomalies or inconsistencies within the data.
  - Strategies for dealing with missing or incomplete data entries.
  - Transformations necessary to align the dataset with our data warehousing standards.

### Data Modeling
- Design a data model suitable for storing the dataset within our data warehouse infrastructure. This involves:
  - Constructing an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to visually represent the data model, capturing the essential entities, attributes, and relationships.
  - Ensuring the data model supports efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of the dataset.

### Data Aggregation and Reporting
- Utilize the developed data model to create a SQL script capable of generating an aggregated report. This report should provide insights into the number of passengers segmented by the following dimensions:
  - **OpCo:** The operational company responsible for the flight segment.
  - **Country:** The country associated with the flight segment.
  - **Region:** The broader geographical region of the flight segment.
  - **Year:** The year in which the flight segment occurred.
  - **Quarter:** The quarter of the year (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) in which the flight segment took place.

The culmination of these objectives will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset's integrity, a structured framework for its storage, and actionable insights through aggregated data analysis.
